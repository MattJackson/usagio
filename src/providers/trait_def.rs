// The provider trait surface below is the crate's provider-facing API: several
// items are only consumed by feature-gated per-provider impls (or by callers
// yet to land), so dead-code warnings on the trait/enum surface itself are
// noise rather than signal. R2-CRAFT-01: narrowed from the previous crate-wide
// #![allow(dead_code)] on providers/mod.rs to just this file (and state.rs).
#![allow(dead_code)]

//! Provider trait scaffolding.
//!
//! This is the core-agents-refactor v1 trait definition: one `Box<dyn Provider>`
//! per module, registered by `providers::init()` in `mod.rs`. Nothing calls
//! into these types yet — the trait, error, and shared value types simply
//! exist so the per-provider modules can start landing in later phases.
