//! macOS menu-bar app: shows the active account's usage in the status bar and
//! lets you switch / capture / remove accounts and set the auto-swap threshold
//! from a dropdown. The same `watch_cycle` that powers `usagio watch` runs
//! on a background thread here, so the daemon behaviour is identical.
//!
//! Usage numbers come from the cache (written by the scheduler poll); the UI
//! never fetches on its own, so menu interactions can't trigger HTTP 429s.
//!
//! Menu wiring iterates `providers::all()` and emits one `ProviderSection` per
//! provider — but only if that provider has at least one captured account in
//! state (see `build_snapshot`). The "Capture current login ▸" submenu always
//! shows, with one row per REGISTERED provider (installed or not).
