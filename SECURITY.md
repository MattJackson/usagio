# Security Policy

`usagio` handles **Claude OAuth tokens** — it stores them in the macOS
Keychain and in `~/.config/usagio/state.json` (owner-only, `0600`), and it
talks only to first-party Anthropic/Claude endpoints. Its hard requirement is that
credentials stay local, stay owner-readable only, and are sent nowhere but the
official endpoints.

Classes of bug that qualify as security issues:

- Token leakage: a token (access or refresh) written to logs, stdout, error
  output, or otherwise exposed.
- World-readable or group-readable token storage — anything that leaves
  `state.json` (or another credential file) with permissions wider than `0600`.
- A code path that sends credentials anywhere other than the official
  Anthropic/Claude endpoints.
- Privilege issues in the `launchd` daemon (e.g. running with more privilege than
  needed, or a way for another local user/process to influence what it does).

## Reporting a vulnerability

not open a public issue for a token-exposure or credential-leak bug until it is
fixed.
