# Third-party notices

This document lists third-party assets bundled inside the `usagio`
binary. Source dependency licenses are collected by `cargo`; this file covers
only assets that ship as bytes inside the binary itself.

## Menu-bar provider icons

The 16px PNG icons in `assets/icons/16/` are decorations shown next to each
provider's section header in the macOS menu bar. They are compiled into the
binary via `include_bytes!` in `src/icons.rs`.
